Take a look at the new design, by following the game flow.
We need to clear the code again and change names, remove comments, etc.
Also we should set readonly memebers where it necessary, and using c'tors to set those readonly members.
take a look what i did in Player's class, and how i'm setting it up from Game class (SetGamePlayers method);

Start tetsting in the morning i will clear the code in parallel
but we need  alot of testing, write all cases you can think, try different board sizes,
follow the eating move when it must to happen.

I've added a random generation for computer while it must eat, so check that too.
